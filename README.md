# ender3marlin
Precompiled Binaries for Ender3 Vanilla Marlin

Due to the difficulty some people are having with getting the latest Marlin (1.1.x-Bugfix) code to compile with Mesh Leveling while still fitting in the constraints of the sanguino1284p's capacity, I have decided to keep an as up to date collection of binaries for people to use.  

These are provided without warranty, expressed or implied, but have been tested to be functional on my Ender 3 Sanguino1284p.

This repository should make it easier for people who wish to upgrade, but do not want to get involved with Arduino code hacking.
